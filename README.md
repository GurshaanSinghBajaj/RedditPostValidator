# Reddit Post Validator

The aim of this project is to provide the end-users with capability to check and determine the stance of the general public on debatable topics present on discussion websites like Reddit through the help of a Chrome web extension. The web extension will allow the users to find out towards which side the general consensus is leaning on various topics. The web extension in its backend will be powered by a Stance Detection classifier which will classify every comment on the post in one of the four categories namely agree, disagree, discuss and unrelated. After classifying all the comments final result is provided which tells towards which side the comments are leaning.

Used BERT for text classification and used the FNC dataset for classification purposes.

Model is not present in the repository.
